## Why?
Because, when it can be done, it's nice to give back to the open source community, from which I've received so much. I live and work thanks to this community, which I am also humbly a part.

In the end, we can all learn like this. As I have been doing since 1996.

## Warning
Do not copy anything directly for reuse. I am not responsible for accusations of fraud that may fall on those who misuse the code that I leave here openly available.

It is suggested to use this code purely as an academic aid, to study and understand the language inner workings. Do your own implementation later, from scratch, without even looking at what I have shared here.
