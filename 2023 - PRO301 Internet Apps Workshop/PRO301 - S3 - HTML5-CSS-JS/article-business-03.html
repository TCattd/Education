					One thing is certain in the stock markets lately: their inherent uncertainty is taking charge, and high volatility is
					here to stay. For months, investors and economists have worried about the recessionary effects of the Federal Reserve’s
					anti-inflationary interest rate hikes – but the recent bank crisis has added another layer of concern to an already
					tumultuous situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, we’re dealing with the fallout from that crisis, and inflation and interest rates both remain high. It’s a textbook
					case for going long on defensive stocks.

					That’s the view of Deep Mehta, a vice president at Goldman Sachs. Closing out the month of March, Mehta says: “Recent
					stress in the banking industry has resulted in renewed investor concerns around the economic growth outlook, and
					increased volatility in risk assets. While the price action stress has somewhat stabilized, potential for reduced credit
					availability is likely to pose a growth headwind as per GS economists. We believe this backdrop warrants selectively
					positioning in more defensive pockets of the market.”

					It’s a mindset that naturally turns us toward dividend stocks. These are the traditional defensive investment plays,
					offering steady payouts to shareholders that guarantee an income stream whether markets go up or down.

					Against this backdrop, Goldman Sachs analysts have given the thumbs-up to two dividend stocks yielding at least 8%.
					Opening up the TipRanks database, we examined the details behind these two to find out what else makes them compelling
					buys.

					Altria Group, Inc. (MO)

					Altria Group is one of the world’s largest cigarette makers, and owns the well-known Marlboro brand. While the company
					has built itself into one of the world’s major public firm through the tobacco industry, in recent years it has begun to
					diversify beyond just cigarettes and other tobacco products. While a diversified product line is usually beneficial, in
					Altria’s case it provides a cushion against changing social and political winds that no longer favor the core tobacco
					product lines.
