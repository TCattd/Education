					With a yield of 9.62%, the recently expired Series I bond was understandably popular. With interest rates rising, bond
					funds are down this year and banks continue to offer miserly rates on deposit accounts. So it’s no wonder that a surging
					horde of investors crashed the Treasury.gov site at the end of last month, trying to beat the clock and lock in the
					highest rate the bonds have paid since they were introduced in 1998.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the day of the Friday, Oct. 28 deadline to lock in the old rate, the Treasury sold $979 million of I bonds. In a bear
					market, this investment that offered robust yield and low risk got investors riled up.

					But now it turns out that investors should have waited. Those who picked up new I bonds yielding 6.89% in the latest
					auction will find themselves making more money in a few years than those who rushed in to grab the old, higher rate. How
					is that possible? Take a deep dive into the intricacies of I Bonds below and consider matching with a financial advisor
					for free to see if I Bonds make sense in your portfolio.

				</p>
				<p>
					The reason is that rates on I bonds are made up of two components: a guaranteed base rate and an adjustable inflation
					rate that changes with every new semi-annual auction. That eye-popping 9.62% rate was guaranteed only for the first six
					months that investors hold their bonds. After that, the rate will be heading down while the rate on the November 2022
					bonds will be steadily staying up.
				</p>
				<p>
					That’s because bonds purchased between May 1, 2020, and Oct. 31, 2022, came with a base rate of 0%. The new bonds are
					being issued with a base rate of 0.40%. The new inflation rate of 6.49% means all those previous investors will get just
					that rate of return, while buyers of the new bonds will get a composite rate that includes the base, giving them 6.89%.
